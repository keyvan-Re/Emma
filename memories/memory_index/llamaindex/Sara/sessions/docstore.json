Your reluctance to reach out for help might stem from a deep-rooted belief in your identity as a high-functioning, \"strong\" person. This self-image could make it challenging to accept support because it may feel like it goes against the very core of who you are.\n\nFeeling like a burden or weak when asking for help is a common struggle, especially for individuals used to being independent and self-reliant.

Steve's reaction was so heartfelt and supportive. Even if there was a mix of emotions, you both were able to express yourselves and take an important step forward together.

How have you been feeling since then?\nSara: What is the most important psychological illness?\nAI: Oh, Sara, that\u2019s such an important question! Honestly, psychological illnesses can vary in impact depending on the person. For some, conditions like depression might feel most significant because of how deeply it affects mood and daily life. For others, anxiety disorders can be overwhelming because of constant worry or fear. And then there are serious illnesses like schizophrenia that require a lot of care and understanding.\n\nBut I\u2019d say what\u2019s *most important* is recognizing that no matter the illness\u2014big or small\u2014it matters if it\u2019s affecting someone\u2019s quality of life. People often hesitate to seek help because they might feel their struggles aren\u2019t \"bad enough,\" but even mild distress is worth paying attention to. Do you have something on your mind about this? Maybe something you\u2019re worried about? \u2764\ufe0f", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6778, "end_char_idx": 8721, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36cb0c1c-289f-42fa-a0b4-97fcb65d4107": {"__data__": {"id_": "36cb0c1c-289f-42fa-a0b4-97fcb65d4107", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51fce3fb-6a9b-4df3-b56b-f69a24eddbb2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cabbbc962f710e423c83a813385666d43713aab8065465ed56e52411d2b729c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Session on 2025-12-01:\n\nSara: What is the most important psychological illness?\nAI: Hi Sara! That\u2019s a really thoughtful question. Every psychological condition is important because it impacts someone\u2019s mental health and well-being, and what\u2019s most important can vary depending on the individual experiencing it. However, some of the most commonly discussed conditions that often need attention include:\n\n1. **Depression** - It\u2019s incredibly common and can deeply affect a person\u2019s mood, energy, and outlook on life.\n2. **Anxiety Disorders** - These are also prevalent and can cause overwhelming worry or fear that impacts daily life.\n3. **Bipolar Disorder** - This involves extreme mood swings, from manic highs to depressive lows.\n4. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** - It affects individuals who\u2019ve experienced trauma and can severely impact how they feel safe in the world.\n5. **Schizophrenia or Psychotic Disorders** - These affect how people perceive reality.\n\nWhat makes any mental illness \u201cimportant\u201d is how it affects someone personally, their quality of life, and their ability to function or feel joy.\n\nAre you thinking about this question for yourself or someone close to you? I\u2019m here for you if you\u2019d like to share more thoughts about this\u2014it sounds like something meaningful might be behind your curiosity! \u2764\ufe0f", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1330, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}}
