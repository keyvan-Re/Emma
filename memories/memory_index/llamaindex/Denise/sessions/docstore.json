Is that right?\nAI: Yes.\nDenise: Keep telling me what's going through your mind right now?\nAI: I can't change anything. It's over. I don't know. It all seems so bleak and hopeless. What do I have to look forward to sickness and then death?\nDenise: So one of the thoughts is that you can't change things, and that it's not going to get any better?\nAI: Yes.\nDenise: And sometimes you believe that completely?\nAI: Yeah, I believe it, sometimes.\nDenise: Right now do you believe it?\nAI: I believe it\u2014yes.\nDenise: Right now you believe that you can't change things and it's not going to get better?\nAI: Well, there is a glimmer of hope, but it's mostly...\nDenise: Is there anything that you kind of look forward to in terms of your own life from here on?\nAI: Well, what I look forward to I enjoy seeing my kids, but they are so busy right now.

Well, I guess just calling my friend Diane in Florida. She called about a month ago and then again last week. Both times I told her I was busy and would call her back, but I haven't. I've felt so down. I have nothing to say to her.\nDenise: Well, when she lived in the area, what kinds of things did you talk about?\nAI: We have kids about the same age, so we would talk about our kids. We both like to read and we used to go to a book club together\u2014so we would talk about the books we were reading. Both of us liked art. We used to attend lectures at the museum during the week, so we would talk about art and the lectures. We would spend time making plans to do things together in our free time. It always was very interesting when I spent time and with her. We had so much in common. I do miss her.\nDenise: It sounds like you used to be involved in a number of interesting activities. What about now?\nAI: After my husband got sick and then my friends moved, I just stopped. I haven't done any of those things in quite a while.\nDenise: What do you think about attending a lecture series now?\nAI: I don't know.\nDenise: Well, what do you think about that idea?\nAI: It's an OK idea, but it just seems like too much. I don't think I'll enjoy it the way I feel I don't know.\nDenise: Would you be willing to test out that thought that you won't be able to enjoy it now?\nAI: I don't know I guess so.\nDenise: Is that a 'yes'?\nAI: Yes, but I don't see how I'm going to get myself to do it.\nDenise: Well, how would you go about finding out about a lecture series?\nAI: You look online at the museum's website to see what's available.\nDenise: OK. Do you have a computer?\nAI: Yes.\nDenise: Is it working?\nAI: Yes.\nDenise: How do you feel about doing that?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1880, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7c8ed66-d6bf-4864-8be1-9c4f3e69da0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7c8ed66-d6bf-4864-8be1-9c4f3e69da0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8c8a99f-436a-4085-90c5-d7be9049a37e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "381a319f4a84f27f7137917691c95cceda96eddc0574546a96338cbb7785953d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1205a27-8f18-44f5-9e77-112e7952a2ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "081eb502e52229f9229c2b953e6f55e6c06f2664249b5225063f4bb15f509645", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "AI: Yes.\nDenise: How do you feel about doing that?\nAI: I guess I could do that I'm so pathetic, I know what to do.

I am still in control of what's important.\nDenise: 'How can that be?'\nAI: Because I can respect myself and respect my friend, as well. I don't have to turn everything into an either-or situation to try to make her see and do it my way. That just makes it difficult for her to get along with me, and I'll lose out on the relationship in the long run if I keep on insisting that she either do it my way or we do nothing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1595, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1b05669-d46d-41e9-a874-ef243d8f78f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1b05669-d46d-41e9-a874-ef243d8f78f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b4ab48f-09a3-414f-91e7-919196428b39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d90381533b64a5a9dbfe8ed9b34a8873a22b50456da2750ca15f68263f3ec02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Session on 2025-04-15:\n\nDenise: If you're flexible, you'll lose control.

You also shared that you admired her spontaneity and adventurous spirit.
