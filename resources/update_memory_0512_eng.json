Stress-related emotions are often tied to specific events or situations and tend to lessen once those stressors are resolved. In contrast, depression symptoms can persist for longer periods (typically more than two weeks) regardless of changes in circumstances.\n\nIf you're unsure about your feelings, it can be beneficial to track your emotions over time. Note how long you've been feeling this way, how intense these emotions are, and whether they interfere with your daily life or relationships.\n\nSeeking support from a mental health professional can provide clarity on your emotional state and guide you toward appropriate coping strategies. Whether it's stress management techniques for situational stress or therapy for depressive symptoms, understanding your emotions is an essential step towards prioritizing your mental well-being.\n\nRemember that both stress and depression are valid experiences that deserve attention and care. Taking proactive steps to address your emotional well-being can lead to a healthier mindset and improved quality of life."
